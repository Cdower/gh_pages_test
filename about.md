The Phi Sigma Kappa Gamma Tetarton Alumni Association owns the Chapter House and is responsible for the on going long term support for the Chapter.

Since our founding on October 15, 1950, the brothers of Phi Sigma Kappa have inspired personal growth and lifelong bonds in over 750 brothers. We now enjoy a
promising future in our historic chapter house, the St Francis de Sales Church. 

This momentous milestone is an opportunity to recommit ourselves to our personal legacy with our fraternity, and to ensure a healthy, functional chapter for our brothers yet to come.

We are setting an ambitious goal of raising $750k to fund critical capital improvement projects which will ensure the sustainability of our chapter
